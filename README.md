## 💎 Why Mega-Skills

Most AI agents fail because they lack a **methodology**. They guess, they hallucinate, and they ignore edge cases. **Mega-Skills** fixes this by injecting 62+ high-fidelity workflows directly into the agent's reasoning loop.

1.  **🔥 62+ Specialized Skills**: From advanced Excel recalculation to autonomous subagent swarms.
2.  **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Structured with native Git symlinks to reduce repository size by **99%** (from ~22,000 files to <600).
3.  **🛠️ Universal Compatibility**: Natively supports **Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Aider, Devin,** and more.
4.  **🏗️ Industrial Grade**: Includes system-level shims for running complex tools in restricted environments.

## 🌟 Trending Skills Spotlight

These are the most-used skills that are changing how developers interact with AI:

### 🦴 Caveman Mode (`caveman`)
**The ultimate token-saver.** Forces agents to communicate in ultra-compressed, technical language. Cuts token usage by ~75% while maintaining 100% precision.
> "Why use many word when few word do trick?"

### 🛡️ Security Auditor (`security-auditor`)
**Red-Team in your pocket.** Automatically performs static analysis to detect SQLi, XSS, and mobile-specific vulnerabilities before they ever hit a branch.

### 🧠 Paper-to-Code (`paper-to-code`)
**Academic implementation on autopilot.** A high-fidelity workflow that extracts math from arXiv PDFs and implements it into production-ready PyTorch or NumPy code.

### 📊 Excel Mastery (`xlsx`)
**Industrial spreadsheet engineering.** Includes a full LibreOffice-powered recalculation engine to ensure formula integrity before the agent claims success.

## ⚡ Unbeatable Skill Combos

Mega-Skills are designed to be **stacked**. Combine these skills to turn your agent into an elite engineering team:

| Combo Name | Skills Stack | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Fortress"** | `security-auditor` + `test-driven-development` | Zero-vulnerability code with 100% test coverage. |
| **The "Scientist"** | `paper-to-code` + `advanced-rag-optimizer` | Implement state-of-the-art research with perfect retrieval grounding. |
| **The "Architect"** | `brainstorming` + `writing-plans` + `subagent-driven-development` | Orchestrate a swarm of agents to build entire multi-file systems from one prompt. |
| **The "Ghost"** | `caveman` + `memory-management` + `sequential-thinking` | Run massive 100+ turn sessions with zero context drift and minimal token cost. |

## 🏗️ The Methodology: "The Golden Path"

Mega-Skills isn't a collection of scripts; it's a **Development OS**.

### 1. Socratic Brainstorming
Before a plan is created, the agent must pass the `brainstorming` phase. It will ask you critical questions about architecture, trade-offs, and user experience. **If the spec isn't clear, the code won't be either.**

### 2. High-Fidelity Planning
The `writing-plans` skill breaks work into atomic units. Each task includes specific file paths, code snippets, and verification commands. This eliminates "hallucinated progress."

### 3. Strict TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)
Mega-Skills enforces **True TDD**. Agents must write a failing test, verify the failure, write the implementation, and verify the pass. This is the only way to guarantee 100% production-ready code.

### 4. Continuous State Management
With `memory-management`, the agent tracks its current task, discovered issues, and architectural decisions in a persistent `.mega-skills/state.json`. **No more context drift in long sessions.**

## 🔒 Security & Reliability

Mega-Skills is built for professional use-cases:

1.  **Socket Shims**: Includes a custom C-level `LD_PRELOAD` shim (`soffice.py`) to run LibreOffice in restricted Unix environments.
2.  **Isolated Macros**: Uses dedicated StarBasic namespaces (`MegaSkillsRecalc`) to prevent conflict with your existing Office configurations.
3.  **Dependency Checks**: Automatic pre-flight verification ensures your environment has `gcc`, `pandoc`, and `soffice` before attempting complex conversions.
