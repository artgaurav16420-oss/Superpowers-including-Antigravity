   1. Meeting facilitation skills
   1. Speaking patterns and ratios
   1. Growth areas for improvement

1. **Analyze Patterns**

   For each requested insight:

   **Conflict Avoidance**:

   1. Look for hedging language ("maybe", "kind of", "I think")
   1. Indirect phrasing instead of direct requests
   1. Changing subject when tension arises
   1. Agreeing without commitment ("yeah, but...")
   1. Not addressing obvious problems

   **Speaking Ratios**:

   1. Track question vs. statement ratios

   **Filler Words**:

   1. Count "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "actually", etc.
   1. Note frequency per minute or per speaking turn
   1. Identify situations where they increase (nervous, uncertain)

   **Active Listening**:

   1. Questions that reference others' previous points

   1. Building on others' contributions

## Examples

### Example 1: Conflict Avoidance Analysis (Inspired by Dan Shipper)

**User**: "I download all of my meeting recordings and put them in a folder. Tell me all the times I've subtly avoided conflict."

**Output**:

```markdown
## Conflict Avoidance Patterns
Found 23 instances across 15 meetings where you used indirect
communication or avoided addressing tensions directly.
## Pattern: Hedging on Critical Feedback
**Frequency**: 8 times across 7 meetings
**Example 1: 1:1 with Sarah** - 00:14:32
**What Happened**:
> "So, I was thinking... maybe we could, like, potentially
> consider looking at the timeline again? I mean, if you
> think that makes sense. But whatever you think is best!"
**Why This Matters**:
You needed to address that Sarah's project was behind schedule,
but the hedging language ("maybe", "potentially", "if you think")
and the deflection at the end ("whatever you think") made it easy
for her to miss the urgency.
**Better Approach**:
"Sarah, the project is two weeks behind schedule. We need to
discuss what's blocking progress and create a new timeline
today."
[Additional examples...]
## Recommendations
1. **Name the issue directly** in the first sentence
2. **Remove hedging words** like "maybe," "kind of," "sort of"
3. **Ask specific questions** instead of hinting
4. **Schedule difficult conversations** instead of raising them casually
```

### Example 2: Leadership Facilitation

**User**: "Analyze my team meetings and tell me about my facilitation style."

**Output**: Provides insights on:

1. How much you speak vs. team members (60% vs. 40%)

1. Whether you ask questions or make statements (3:1 ratio)

1. How you handle disagreements (tendency to resolve too quickly)

1. Who speaks least and whether you draw them in

1. Examples of good and missed facilitation moments

### Example 3: Personal Development Tracking

**User**: "Compare my meetings from Q1 vs. Q2 to see if I've improved my listening skills."

**Output**: Creates a comparative analysis showing:

1. Decrease in interruptions (8 per meeting → 3 per meeting)

1. Increase in clarifying questions (2 → 7 per meeting)

1. Improvement in building on others' ideas

1. Specific examples showing the difference

1. Remaining areas for growth
