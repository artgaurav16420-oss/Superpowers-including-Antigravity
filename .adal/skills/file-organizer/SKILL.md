# File Organizer

This skill acts as your personal organization assistant, helping you maintain a clean, logical file structure across your computer without the mental overhead of constant manual organization.

## When to Use This Skill

- Your Downloads folder is a chaotic mess

- You can't find files because they're scattered everywhere

- You have duplicate files taking up space

- Your folder structure doesn't make sense anymore

- You want to establish better organization habits

- You're starting a new project and need a good structure

- You're cleaning up before archiving old projects

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes Current Structure**: Reviews your folders and files to understand what you have

1. **Finds Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate files across your system

1. **Suggests Organization**: Proposes logical folder structures based on your content

1. **Automates Cleanup**: Moves, renames, and organizes files with your approval

1. **Maintains Context**: Makes smart decisions based on file types, dates, and content

1. **Reduces Clutter**: Identifies old files you probably don't need anymore

## How to Use

### From Your Home Directory

```text
cd ~
```

Then run Claude Code and ask for help:

```text
Help me organize my Downloads folder
```

```text
Find duplicate files in my Documents folder
```

```text
Review my project directories and suggest improvements
```

### Specific Organization Tasks

```text
Organize these downloads into proper folders based on what they are
```

```text
Find duplicate files and help me decide which to keep
```

```text
Clean up old files I haven't touched in 6+ months
```

```text
Create a better folder structure for my [work/projects/photos/etc]
```

## Instructions

When a user requests file organization help:

1. **Understand the Scope**

   Ask clarifying questions:

   - Which directory needs organization? (Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)
   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)
   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)
   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)

1. **Analyze Current State**

   Review the target directory:

   ```bash
## Get overview of current structure
   ls -la [target_directory]
## Check file types and sizes
   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \; | head -20
## Identify largest files
   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20
## Count file types
   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```

   Summarize findings:

   - Total files and folders
   - File type breakdown
   - Size distribution
   - Date ranges
   - Obvious organization issues

1. **Identify Organization Patterns**

   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:

   **By Type**:

   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)
   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)
   - Videos (MP4, MOV)
   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)
   - Code/Projects (directories with code)
   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)
   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)

   **By Purpose**:

   - Work vs. Personal
   - Active vs. Archive
   - Project-specific
   - Reference materials
   - Temporary/scratch files

   **By Date**:

   - Current year/month
   - Previous years
   - Very old (archive candidates)

1. **Find Duplicates**

   When requested, search for duplicates:

   ```bash
## Find exact duplicates by hash
   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \; | sort | uniq -d
## Find files with same name
   find [directory] -type f -printf '%f\n' | sort | uniq -d
## Find similar-sized files
   find [directory] -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n
   ```

   For each set of duplicates:

   - Show all file paths
   - Display sizes and modification dates
   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)
   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting

1. **Propose Organization Plan**

   Present a clear plan before making changes:

   ```markdown
## Organization Plan for [Directory]
## Current State

   - X files across Y folders
   - [Size] total
   - File types: [breakdown]
   - Issues: [list problems]

## Proposed Structure
   ```

   [Directory]/
   ├── Work/
   │   ├── Projects/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Archive/
   ├── Personal/
   │   ├── Photos/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Media/
   └── Downloads/
       ├── To-Sort/
       └── Archive/

   ```text
## Changes I'll Make

   1. **Create new folders**: [list]
   1. **Move files**:
      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/
      - Y images → Personal/Photos/
      - Z old files → Archive/
   1. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]
   1. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]

## Files Needing Your Decision

   - [List any files you're unsure about]

   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)
   ```

1. **Execute Organization**

   After approval, organize systematically:

   ```bash
## Create folder structure
   mkdir -p "path/to/new/folders"
## Move files with clear logging
   mv "old/path/file.pdf" "new/path/file.pdf"
## Rename files with consistent patterns
## Example: "YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext"
   ```

   **Important Rules**:

   - Always confirm before deleting anything
   - Log all moves for potential undo
   - Preserve original modification dates
   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully
   - Stop and ask if you encounter unexpected situations

1. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**

   After organizing:

   ```markdown
## Organization Complete! ✨
## What Changed

   - Created [X] new folders
   - Organized [Y] files
   - Freed [Z] GB by removing duplicates
   - Archived [W] old files

## New Structure
   [Show the new folder tree]
## Maintenance Tips
   To keep this organized:

   1. **Weekly**: Sort new downloads
   1. **Monthly**: Review and archive completed projects
   1. **Quarterly**: Check for new duplicates
   1. **Yearly**: Archive old files

## Quick Commands for You
   ```

## Find files modified this week

   find . -type f -mtime -7

## Sort downloads by type

   [custom command for their setup]

## Find duplicates

   [custom command]

   ```text
   Want to organize another folder?
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Organizing Downloads (From Justin Dielmann)

**User**: "My Downloads folder is a mess with 500+ files. Help me organize it."

**Process**:

1. Analyzes Downloads folder

1. Finds patterns: work docs, personal photos, installers, random PDFs

1. Proposes structure:
   - Downloads/
     - Work/
     - Personal/
     - Installers/ (DMG, PKG files)
     - Archive/
     - ToSort/ (things needing decisions)

1. Asks for confirmation

1. Moves files intelligently based on content and names

1. Results: 500 files → 5 organized folders

### Example 2: Finding and Removing Duplicates

**User**: "Find duplicate files in my Documents and help me decide which to keep."

**Output**:

```markdown
## Found 23 Sets of Duplicates (156 MB total)
## Duplicate Set 1: "proposal.pdf"
- `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)
- `/Documents/old/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)
- `/Desktop/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-10)
**Recommendation**: Keep `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (most recent in correct location)
Delete the other 2 copies?
[Continue for all duplicates...]
```

### Example 3: Restructuring Projects Folder

**User**: "Review my ~/Projects directory and suggest improvements."

**Output**:

```markdown
## Analysis of ~/Projects
## Current Structure Issues
- Mix of active and archived projects (3+ years old)
- No consistent naming convention
- Some projects at root, others in random subfolders
- Duplicate folders (project-name, project-name-old, project-name-v2)
## Proposed Structure
```

Projects/
├── Active/
│   ├── client-work/
│   ├── side-projects/
│   └── learning/
├── Archive/
│   ├── 2022/
│   ├── 2023/
│   └── 2024/
└── Templates/

```text
## Specific Changes
1. Move 12 projects not touched since 2022 → Archive/
2. Consolidate 4 duplicate project folders
3. Rename projects to consistent format: "client-name-project-name"
4. Create Archive for old work
Want me to implement this?
```

### Example 4: Organizing Photos by Date

**User**: "Organize my photo folders by year and month."

**Output**: Creates structure like:

```text
Photos/
├── 2023/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   ├── 02-February/
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   └── ...
└── Unsorted/
```

Then moves photos based on EXIF data or file modification dates.

## Common Organization Tasks

### Downloads Cleanup

```text
Organize my Downloads folder - move documents to Documents,
images to Pictures, keep installers separate, and archive files
older than 3 months.
```

### Project Organization

```text
Review my Projects folder structure and help me separate active
projects from old ones I should archive.
```

### Duplicate Removal

```text
Find all duplicate files in my Documents folder and help me
decide which ones to keep.
```

### Desktop Cleanup

```text
My Desktop is covered in files. Help me organize everything into
my Documents folder properly.
```

### Photo Organization

```text
Organize all photos in this folder by date (year/month) based
on when they were taken.
```

### Work/Personal Separation

```text
Help me separate my work files from personal files across my
Documents folder.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one messy folder (like Downloads) to build trust

1. **Regular Maintenance**: Run weekly cleanup on Downloads

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use "YYYY-MM-DD - Description" format for important files

1. **Archive Aggressively**: Move old projects to Archive instead of deleting

1. **Keep Active Separate**: Maintain clear boundaries between active and archived work

1. **Trust the Process**: Let Claude handle the cognitive load of where things go

## Best Practices

### Folder Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names

- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)

- Be specific: "client-proposals" not "docs"

- Use prefixes for ordering: "01-current", "02-archive"

### File Naming

- Include dates: "2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md"

- Be descriptive: "q3-financial-report.xlsx"

- Avoid version numbers in names (use version control instead)

- Remove download artifacts: "document-final-v2 (1).pdf" → "document.pdf"

### When to Archive

- Projects not touched in 6+ months

- Completed work that might be referenced later

- Old versions after migration to new systems

- Files you're hesitant to delete (archive first)
